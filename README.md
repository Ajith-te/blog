  - All users (including non-authenticated users) can view a list of all blog posts.
  - Users can view individual blog posts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Django 3.x

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ajith-te/blog.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd blog
```

### 3. Set up a virtual environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 4. Install dependencies

Install the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Configure Database

- If you are using **MongoDB**, make sure it is running on your machine or configure it in the `settings.py` file.
- If you are using **MySQL**, configure your database in the `settings.py` file.

### 6. Apply database migrations

Run the following command to apply all migrations and set up the database:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 7. Create a superuser

To access the Django admin panel, create a superuser:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 8. Start the development server

Now, you can start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
